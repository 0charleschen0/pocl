pocl works (as of 2012-11-21) quite well on a Panda board with
Ubuntu.

Current known issues:

- You might need to install libhwloc from the sources if
  the Ubuntu in Panda doesn't ship a new enough one.
  http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/
- ABI/ISA compatibility issue (soft float or not). This is
  producible in the example1 which takes float4 buffers as args.
  example2, which uses scalar buffers works ok.
