pocl supports some environment variables to control its behavior as follows:

POCL_DEVICES and POCL_DEVICEn_PARAMETERS

POCL_DEVICES is a space separated list of the device instances to be enabled. 
Currently supported device types are: 

          basic        A minimalistic example device driver for executing
                       kernels on the host CPU. No multithreading.

          pthread      Native kernel execution on the host CPU with
                       threaded execution of work groups using pthreads.

          ttasim       Device that simulates a TTA device using the
                       TCE's ttasim library. Enabled only if TCE libraries
                       installed.

Device-specific parameters can be given with POCL_DEVICEn_PARAMETERS where
n is the number of the device in the POCL_DEVICES list (starting from zero).

Example:

  export POCL_DEVICES="pthread ttasim" 
  export POCL_DEVICE1_PARAMETERS="/path/to/my/machine.adf"

Creates two devices, one CPU device with pthread multithreading and a
TTA device simulated with the ttasim. The ttasim device gets a path to
the architecture description file of the tta to simulate as a parameter.

POCL_KERNEL_COMPILER_OPT_SWITCH

Override the default "-O3" that is passed to the LLVM opt as a final
optimization switch.

POCL_LEAVE_TEMP_DIRS 

If this is set to 1, the kernel compiler temporary directory that contains
all the intermediate compiler files is left to /tmp. Otherwise, it is
be cleaned in clReleaseProgram.

POCL_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE 

Forces the maximum WG size returned by the device or kernel work group quries
to be at most this number. 

POCL_MAX_PTHREAD_COUNT

The maximum number of threads created for work group execution in the
pthread device driver. The default is to determine this from the number of
hardware threads available in the CPU.

POCL_VECTORIZE_WORK_GROUPS

If set to 0, disables the (experimental) work group vectorizer that builds 
vector instructions from multiple work items. Enabled by default.
