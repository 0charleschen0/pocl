pocl supports some environment variables to control its behavior. They
are as follows:

POCL_LEAVE_TEMP_DIRS 

If this is set to 1, the kernel compiler temporary directory that contains
all the intermediate compiler files is left to /tmp. Otherwise, it is
be cleaned in clReleaseProgram.

POCL_MAX_WORK_GROUP_SIZE 

Forces the maximum WG size returned by the device or kernel work group quries
to be at most this number. 

POCL_MAX_PTHREAD_COUNT

The maximum number of threads created for work group execution in the
pthread device driver. The default is to determine this from the number of
hardware threads available in the CPU.
