coding style
============

The coding style of the pocl is a bit mixed, but the
following main principles shall be followed:

1) In the C code (all the code base except for the LLVM modules),
   follow the GNU style.

   http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Writing-C.html

2) In the LLVM passes (C++), follow the LLVM coding guidelines
   so it is easy to upstream general code to the LLVM project 
   at any point.

   http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html

It's known that the pocl code base does not adhere to these principles,
but the aim is to gradually fix this.
