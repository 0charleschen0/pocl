Portable Computing Language (pocl) v0.8 released
------------------------------------------------

[TODO]

Pocl aims to be an efficient open source (MIT-licensed) 
implementation of the OpenCL 1.2 standard. 

In addition to producing an easily portable open source OpenCL
implementation, another major goal of the project is improving 
performance portability of OpenCL programs with compiler 
optimizations, reducing the need for target-dependent manual 
optimizations. 

At the core of pocl is the kernel compiler that consists of a 
set of LLVM passes used to statically generate multiple work-item
work group functions of kernels, even in the presence of work-group 
barriers. These functions are suitable for parallelization in multiple 
ways (SIMD, VLIW, superscalar,...).

This release adds  ... [TODO]

Even though the OpenCL 1.2 standard is not yet implemented fully and
it contains known bugs, we consider pocl ready for wider scale testing. 
The pocl 0.8 test suite compiles and runs most of the ViennaCL 1.3.1 examples, 
Rodinia 2.0.1 benchmarks, Parboil benchmarks, OpenCL Programming Guide book
samples and the AMD APP SDK v2.8 OpenCL samples, ... [TODO]

Acknowledgements
----------------
We'd like to thank the Radio Implementation Research Team from Nokia
Research Center and Academy of Finland (funding decision 253087) for
funding the development of this release. 

Thanks to Victor Oliveira for his first code contributions to the
project and for testing pocl with the GEGL OpenCL filters.
