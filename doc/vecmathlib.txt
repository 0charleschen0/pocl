Vecmathlib implementations for the math lib can be used 
as follows:

a) ensure you have a functional clang++ installed 
b) 'git clone' the vecmathlib project under 'kernel'.
   Revision 07450b7 (from 2013-03-24) has been used succesfully.
c) generate the pocl wrappers using ./generate-files.py under
   vecmathlib/pocl

Then pocl configure script should now detect that you want to compile
vecmathlib, and the x86_64 kernel is be built using vecmathlib's
versions for the math built-ins.
