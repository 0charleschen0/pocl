Vecmathlib implementations for the built-in math lib can be compiled in 
as follows:

a) ensure you have a functional clang++ installed 
b) 'git clone' the vecmathlib project under 'kernel'
c) generate the pocl files using ./generate-files.py under
   vecmathlib/pocl

Then pocl configure script should now detect that you want to compile
vecmathlib, and the x86_64 kernel is tried to be built using vecmathlib's
versions for the math built-ins.

Known issues
------------

* clang++ does not work with libstdc++ shipped with Debian 6.0 in 
-std=gnu++11 mode that is required by vecmathlib.

* clamp.cl does not include (signed, signed, signed) implementation that
  is available in the pocl's default implementation. It is used from 
  pocl for now.
