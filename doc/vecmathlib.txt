Vecmathlib implementations for the built-in math lib can be compiled in 
as follows:

a) ensure you have clang++ installed and functions
b) check out the vecmathlib project under 'kernel'
c) generate the pocl files using ./generate-files.py under
   vecmathlib/pocl

Then pocl configure script should detect that you want to compile
vecmathlib and tries to compile its versions as a replacement for the math
builtins.

Currently it doesn't compile for me (Pekka) because some C++ header
issues. It's a work in progress.
