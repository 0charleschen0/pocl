Vecmathlib implementations for the built-in math lib can be compiled in 
as follows:

a) ensure you have a functional clang++ installed 
b) 'git clone' the vecmathlib project under 'kernel'
c) generate the pocl files using ./generate-files.py under
   vecmathlib/pocl

Then pocl configure script should now detect that you want to compile
vecmathlib, and the x86_64 kernel is tried to be built using vecmathlib's
versions for the math built-ins.

Currently it doesn't compile for me (Pekka) because of some C++ header
issues. It's a work in progress.
