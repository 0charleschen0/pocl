Portable OpenCL (pocl) v0.6 released
------------------------------------

Portable OpenCL is an open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of 
the OpenCL 1.2 standard. 

In addition to producing an easily portable open source OpenCL
implementation, another major goal of the project is improving 
performance portability of OpenCL programs with compiler 
optimizations, reducing the need for target-dependent manual 
optimizations. An important part of pocl is a set of LLVM passes 
used to statically parallelize multiple work-items with the kernel
compiler, even in the presence of work-group barriers. This enables 
exploitation of fine-grained static parallelism in the work groups in 
multiple ways (SIMD, vector, VLIW, superscalar,...).

The code base is structured to allow adding new "device drivers"
for the host-device layer. Currently a single generic multithreaded 
"target driver" is included. It allows running OpenCL applications on 
a host that supports the pthread library with multithreading at
the work group granularity.

An optimized kernel library is provided for x86_64. The generic
unoptimized (no instruction set extensions used) version has been 
successfully used with an ARMv7 CPU under Meego, and with several 
application-specific TTA processors designed using the TCE toolset.

Even though the OpenCL 1.2 standard is not yet implemented fully, we 
consider pocl now ready for wider scale testing. pocl 0.6 compiles and 
runs successfully the Rodinia benchmark, ViennaCL and most of the
OpenCL Programming Guide Samples.
