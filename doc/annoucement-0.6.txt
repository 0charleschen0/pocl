Portable OpenCL (pocl) v0.6 released
------------------------------------

Portable OpenCL is an open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of 
the OpenCL 1.2 standard. 

In addition to producing an easily portable open source OpenCL
implementation, another major goal of the project is improving 
performance portability of OpenCL programs with compiler 
optimizations, reducing the need for target-dependent manual 
optimizations. An important part of pocl is a set of LLVM passes 
used to statically parallelize multiple work-items with the kernel
compiler, even in the presence of work-group barriers. This enables 
exploitation of fine-grained static parallelism in the work groups in 
multiple ways (SIMD, vector, VLIW, superscalar,...).

The code base is structured to allow adding new "device drivers"
for the host-device layer. Currently a single generic multithreaded 
"target driver" is included. It allows running OpenCL kernels on 
a host that supports the pthread threading library. 

An optimized kernel library is provided for x86_64 and the generic 
(no instruction set extensions used) version has been successfully used 
with ARMv4 CPU and the TCE toolset.

The OpenCL 1.2 standard is not yet fully implemented, but we consider
pocl now ready for wider scale testing. pocl compiles and runs 
successfully the Rodinia testbench, ViennaCL and most of the
OpenCL Programming Guide Samples.
