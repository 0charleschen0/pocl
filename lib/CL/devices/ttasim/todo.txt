- basic features:
  - reading of data back from the tta global memory
  - sub buffers
  - local memory allocation (at the host side)
    - static
    - dynamic
- reorganize dir structure to 
  - tce/ttasim
  - tce/plda-tta
- plda-tta:
  - refactor common code between ttasim and plda-tta
  - implement plda driver hooks
- optimizations:
  - bufalloc instead of malloc inside the device
- cleanup code:
  - free allocations for the kernel command constructs
- clEnqueueCopyBuffer:
  - inside the same device 
  - between multiple devices
- proper schedule generation (process the command queue
  as an entity)
- out of order command queues
