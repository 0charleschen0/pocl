0.7  unreleased
===============

OpenCL Platform Layer implementations (specs Chapter 4)
-------------------------------------------------------

- clGetDeviceInfo can now use the hwloc lib for device property
  queries. Still to exploit fully.

Framework
---------

- Made it possible to override the .cl -> .bc build command
  called by clBuildProgram per device. Used it to implement
  calls to (custom) hardware operations in the TTA devices.

0.6   August 2012
=================

Kernel library 
--------------

- Added initial optimized kernel library for X86_64/SSE.
- Preliminary support for ARM architectures on Linux
  (briefly tested on MeeGo/Nokia N9).

Pthread device driver
---------------------

- Multithreading at the work group granularity using pthreads.
- Tries to figure out the optimal maximum number of
  threads for the system based on the available hardware
  threads. Currently works only in Linux using the 
  /proc/cpuinfo interface.
- Region-based customized memory allocator for speeding up buffer 
  allocations.

Kernel compiler
---------------

- Most of the tricky work group barrier cases (barriers inside 
  for-loops etc) now supported.
- Support for local variables, also automatic locals.
- Reuse previous compilation results, if available.
- Automatic vectorization of work groups (multiple work items
  in parallel).
  
Miscellaneous  
-------------
- Installable Client Driver (icd) support.
- Event profiling support (incomplete, works only for kernel and
  buffer read/write/map/unmap events).

Known issues
------------

- Non-pointer struct kernel arguments fail due to varying ABIs
  * https://bugs.launchpad.net/pocl/+bug/987905
- Produces always "fully unrolled" chains of work items for
  work groups causing code size explosion for large WGs.
