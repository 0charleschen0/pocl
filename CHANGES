-----------------

Kernel library: 

- Added initial optimized kernel library for X86_64/SSE.
- Preliminary support for ARM architectures on Linux
  (briefly tested on MeeGo/Nokia N9).

Multithreaded native device:

- Multithreading at the work group granularity using pthreads.
- Tries to figure out the optimal maximum number of
  threads for the system based on the available hardware
  threads. Currently works only in Linux using the 
  /proc/cpuinfo interface.

Kernel compiler:

- Tricky work group barrier cases (barriers inside for-loops etc)
  now supported.
