piglit test suite contains OpenCL tests which are useful to
get working.

How to start:

git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/piglit
cd piglit
ccmake .
# It should open the cmake's curses GUI. Select only the CL tests and
# the need for waffle.

# Build the piglit test framework
make

# Setup ocl-icd to use the build tree pocl
export OCL_ICD_VENDORS=LOCATION_TO_POCL_ROOT/ocl-vendors

# Run the OCL test suite
./piglit-run.py tests/all_cl.tests results/all

# Produce a summary HTML page of the results
./piglit-summary-html.py summary/pocl results/all/main

# Now under summary/pocl there should be index.html etc. which
# can be used to browse the test results and logs.
