Enable building the ViennaCL suite as a pocl test case. ViennaCL will
be compiled, if its sources are extracted in this directory.
 
You can use '--enable-testsuite-viennacl' configure option
or you can do it yourself:
Download and unpack the ViennaCL package:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/viennacl/files/1.2.x/ViennaCL-1.2.0-src.tar.gz
into this directory.

Then, in pocl toplevel source dir run 'make check' or
'make TESTSUITEFLAGS="-k viennacl" check' to run the ViennaCL tests.
