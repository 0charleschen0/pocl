To enable the OpenCV tests:

1) run 'make opencv-3.0.0-beta.zip' to download OpenCV

2) configure pocl, it should now detect the OpenCV benchmark and
   enable it. You need cmake to get it built.

3) call 'make prepare-examples' once to get the examples built

4) call 'make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="-k opencv"', it should build 
   the OpenCV cases and run the pocl test suite for the OpenCV.

After this you can run tools/scripts/benchmark.py to produce
performance numbers.
