Portable OpenCL --- TODO

High priority:
    * complete kernel runtime library.
    * make workgroups thread-safe.
    * create workgroups by looping instead of fully unrolling.
    * handle barriers inside loops.
    * proper support for automatic local variables.

Medium priority:
    * complete host runtime library.
    * vectorize workgroups.
    * native-thread device which uses threads for different workgroups.
    * ttasim target (heterogeneous TCE scenario).
    * device supporting ATI cards.
    * device supporting IBM Cell BE.

Low priority:
    * gdb target (generates code for any llvm-compatible target and launches.
      workgroups on gdb simulator).
    * standalone target (and standalone-threading?).
    * ICD support.
