Portable OpenCL --- TODO

High priority:
    * make NVIDIA OpenCL SDK examples to work (1.0)
    * make Intel OpenCL SDK examples to work (1.0)    
    * make AMD OpenCL SDK examples to work (1.0)        
    * create workgroups by looping instead of fully unrolling for
      flexible WG parallelization (1.0)

Medium priority:
    * device selection at runtime.
    * complete kernel runtime library.   
    * complete host runtime library.
    * vectorize workgroups.
    * ttasim target (heterogeneous TCE scenario).
    * device supporting ATI cards.

Low priority:
    * gdb target (generates code for any llvm-compatible target and launches.
      workgroups on gdb simulator).
    * standalone target (and standalone-mt).
    * ICD support.
    * device supporting IBM Cell BE.

(1.0) == requirement for the pocl 1.0 release
