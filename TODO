Portable OpenCL --- TODO

High priority:
    * get_global_size implementation
    * complete kernel runtime library.
    * make workgroups thread-safe.
    * create workgroups by looping instead of fully unrolling.
    * handle barriers inside loops.

Medium priority:
    * complete host runtime library.
    * vectorize workgroups.
    * native-multithread (mt) device which creates N threads for different workgroups.
    * ttasim target (heterogeneous TCE scenario).
    * device supporting ATI cards.

Low priority:
    * gdb target (generates code for any llvm-compatible target and launches.
      workgroups on gdb simulator).
    * standalone target (and standalone-mt).
    * ICD support.
    * device supporting IBM Cell BE.
