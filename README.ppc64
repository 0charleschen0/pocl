-----------------

Works and many tests run successfully on a Debian Sid with PowerPC 64 
in a 64 bit userland with LLVM 3.2. Tested using the Cell of PlayStation 3.

All OpenCL specification tests pass.
The first kennel runtime library test fails (abs bitselect ...).
All Workgroup creation tests fail.
All Regression tests pass.

Did not yet test the external OpenCL project tests.

to do
-----

- The threshold for wirepl is too large. The PowerPC of the Cell PPU 
  supports AltiVec which is capable of 4-wide f32 vectorization only. 
  Thus, a sensible threshold is probably at most 8 or so. This should be
  sniffed from the device driver somehow.
